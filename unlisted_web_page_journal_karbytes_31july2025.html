<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>A few months ago, I <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_29march2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> that I wanted to keep the zip file size of each additional karbytes <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/micro_directory_definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;micro directory&#8221;</a> beneath 300 megabytes total (for the sake of keeping those zip files easy to download and store). Because the current &#8220;micro directory&#8221; (which is associated with the GitHub repository named <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_46/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_46&#8221;</a>) is already approximately 205 megabytes (and because there is a lot of content in that repository I think should be sealed off from further changes which I think has historical value documenting what I feel is a personal evolution) I decided to finalize that &#8220;micro directory&#8221; today (and burn at least three M_DISCs today such that each of those discs contains exclusively the (finalized) version of karbytes named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;karbytes2025_19&#8221;</a>).</p>
<p>What I did not do was publish the next &#8220;micro directory&#8221; before finalizing &#8220;karbytes2025_19&#8221; (and the next &#8220;micro directory&#8221; will be associated with the GitHub repository named &#8220;KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_47&#8221;). That is because I wanted to let &#8220;KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_46&#8221; stay prominently showcased as a pinned GitHub repository in my GitHub profile (and the username to that GitHub repository is @karlinarayberinger) for at least three consecutive days (but probably no longer than two months). I expect &#8220;KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_47&#8221; to be drier and more data compact than &#8220;KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_46&#8221; and, also, I expect &#8220;KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_47&#8221; to stay open to changes for a longer time interval (but not for a time period whose end point is after 31_DECEMBER_2025).</p>
<p>I enjoyed developing karbytes from &#8220;karbytes2025_18&#8221; to &#8220;karbytes2025_19&#8221; and am pleased with the many treasures this fruitful development phase yielded. I anticipate many more fruitful development phases to come. Between now and the initial public release of the next &#8220;micro directory&#8221;, I will be working on drafting new karbytes content in a secret anonymous GitHub account and backing up those drafts to the WayBack Machine. I will also be taking time to enjoy the beauty of nature and studying science, technology, and the arts. </p>
<p>Well, time to go! My essence will always be here in the digital labyrinth referred to as <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes</a> (and whose main entry points are the following two web addresses):</p>
<p>website_0: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
